# my_torchgeo
In this repository, I put a simple template which I can use to build image segmentation tasks using torchgeo. I implement a number of things such as combining both images and vector labels/masks. Adding augmentations, both indices and rotations/flips. Capturing evaluation metrics and save as .csv file. Saving best model at highest validation IoU.
