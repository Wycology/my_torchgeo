# my_torchgeo
In this repository, I put a simple template that can be used to build image segmentation tasks using torchgeo. I implement:
1. Combining images and vector labels/masks.
2. Adding augmentations, both indices and rotations/flips.
3. Capturing evaluation metrics and save to .csv file.
4. Saving best model at highest validation IoU.
